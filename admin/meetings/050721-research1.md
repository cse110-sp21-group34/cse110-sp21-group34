#### Decisions
-	Lazy Loading might be implemented, but not necessary.
-   Image loading is extra stuff we won't worry about it now.
-   Log in system and encryption is not necessary.
-   We will store the label's points in a list for easier searching.
-   Each date will have its own list of label.
-   Each label will have its own list of dates that are attached to it.
-   Different bullet types are implemented as lists in html.
-   The API will implement how we will switch between bullet styles.

#### Next time:
-	Assign ourselves to Github issues.
-   Do not immedediately push to master branch.
-   Jinghao and Haoxuan will focus on design for HTML and CSS (Taorui might help later).
-   Gaurav will finish ADR's by Sunday, Monday by worst.
-   Discuss status video 1.
#### Who will code what:
-   Yiteng will do storage.
-   Joseph, Steven, Zhouliang and Taorui will do text editor API and changing bullet styles, along with nested bullets.
-   Jinghao, Haoxuan, and Yang will work on the HTML.

-   Label creation will be done after storage is done.



#### Notes:
-	Storage is complicated jesus.
-   We might use Google API, but worst case we code it ourselves (we are waiting for TA approval).
