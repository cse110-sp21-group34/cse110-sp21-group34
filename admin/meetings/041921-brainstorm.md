#### What we did (BrainStorming):
-   Meeting summary
    -   Goals: Discuss the basic structure of bullet journal or any features added upon this journal
    -   Major Ideas
        -   What to show on the interface
        -   Side panels(choose days)
        -   Keywords & Labels & Search Function
        -   Personalization 
-   Miro (used for brainstorming activity)
-   Bullet Journal Characteristics
    -   Simple,Clean UI, User-convenient, intuitive
    -   Seperated into days 
    -   No paragraphs(should be listed organizedly)
-   Brainstorming ideas
    -   Land in the blank journal zoomed in a single day 
        -   Can switch between different modes/user preferences
        -   Potential concerns:
            -   user sometimes don't remember exact date and might need to set up tasks on different days which isn't convenient for users 
            -   Week or month list would be more convenient
    - Side Panel/Menu to switch between categories
        -   Place today's journal at the middle and side panels can allow different selections and scope 
        -   Expand side panels -> zooming from year -> month -> day 
        -   Extra Ideas(for mobiles): Use a bottom slide bar that navigates between days. If fully slided upwards, entire month is shown
            -   (If it is a horizontal side panel) We can use a scrollable menu that allows month selection and then the epxanded panel shows the days (in terms of number and correspondence to Mon/Tues/Wed,etc) 
                -   Scrolling between months also scrolls between years 
    - Keywords & Labels
      - Keywords: For each journal entry, the highlight/keyword is automatically generated so that user can be easily identify their major events and experiences
        - Search days based on keywords
        - Can make suggested labels based on keyword search(For example, if the keyword "lift up" appears frequently, we can suggest the user to create "lift up" label)
        - Potential concern: 
          - Might be a bit messy on the interface
          - Might get undesired results
      - Labels: Some custom labels created by the user, allow better categorization of the type of events
        - Labels can be headings within that journal entry
      - Integration: Placed labels on top of the page, and keywords just below those labels, so that user can easily search
        - Alternative: show labels for each day if we expand the side panel
      - Additional/Related features : Search Function => Allow searching of specific words
        - Add filter to search function(Search by months, weeks, days) -> shows the frequency of the occrruences that corresponding days
      - Notifications
        - Give notifications or put specific colorings/labels that emphasizes important events or days
        - Can use color coding to also hint/signal users and for better visualization
    - Expanded Mode vs. Timeline Mode (on Miro)
      - Timeline Mode: Only labels are shown
    - Printing and Exporting the bullet journal
      - Filter the items to be printed by labels(can do with multiple selections)
    - Personalization
      - Give the option to drag different parts
        - Concerns:
          - Too much dragging are going to make it overcomplicated and a lof of extra work
          - CounterArgument: If images are placed not beside the corresponding contents, the irrelevance decreases user experience
      - Give some templates for the bullet journal
      - Aim: Customize the journals according to their own style
      - Potential Provided Options: Color, positions of the images
      - Customized bulletpoints  -> numbering  & listing
        - Can place a side bar on the right that provides those customized options
      - Customization of edits (fontSize & fontFamily and etc)
        - Placed on the top(between labels and body of the journal) and shouldn't shift when scrolling (should be static)
    - Mischallaenous Additional features 
      - When expanding on a particular day, use hyperlinks to place navigate between sections within a journal entry
        - The most-bulleted section will be shown on the side panel when scrolling across days
    - use color and shapes to boost experience
