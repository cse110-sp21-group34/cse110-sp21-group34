### Brian Wang
Hi, My name is [Brian Wang](https://github.com/Brian96086), a 2nd year data science trying to transfer to computer science major(and suffering from waiting application result). My hobbies are playing sports as well as reading books. One fun fact about myself is that I really like to eat ice cream, to the extent that I ate 23 scoops in an all-you-can eat buffet. For my future, I am not sure if I want to pursue as a software engineer/developer or to become a data scientist and work in machine learning fields/AI, but so far, I like both of them !!! I look foward to working with these awesome people !

### Jinghao Miao
Hello guys! My name is Jinghao Miao (Tony) and I'm now 2nd year computer science student in ERC. I come from China and now studying remotely here. I love listening to musics, almost including every genre, playing games, especially Star Citizen, and playing pools and snooker. For my future, I'm now aiming to become an algorithm engineer of AI. Let's have a nice quarter and teamwork!
### Joseph Priyanto
Hi everyone! My name is Joseph Christopher Priyanto, and I go by Chris. I'm a third year student and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am currnetly in my home country, Indonesia. What I do for a hobby is that I often play video games with my friends, I watch Netflix, and I love trying out new foods! I aspire to be a Software Engineer which could create new things that could help the people in need who doesn't have the access to the current technology we have.
### Steven Youssef
### Taorui Wang
Hello everyone, my name is [Taorui Wang](https://github.com/t2wang)(Tony) and I'm a third computer engineering student from China. My hobbies involve Soccer, gaming, skiing and watching all kinds of shows. I plan to work in HCI-related field in the future so feel free to chat with me about it or anything else!
### Yang Yue
I am Yang Yue, second-year student from Warren College. My major is Computer Science, but I am more interested in Mathematics, especially Combinatorics and Graph Theory. They are powerful tools for several area in computer science, such as data structure and algorithm designs. I have no project experience yet. My coding skills are just what learned from UCSDâ€™s computer science courses. I will learn and try my best to facilitate our project development. Also, I am determined to overcome procrastination in this quarter. Cheer up!
### Yiteng Zhao
Hi, this is [Yiteng Zhao](https://github.com/gordon-zhao). I'm a second-year CE student from Warren. I have little experience on software development. My hobby is messing around with computer hardwares and robots. Games I play are Osu, BanG Dream, Forza Horizon 4, Dirt Rally, LOL, but I'm suck at all of them. Sometimes watch anime. Currently I'm interested in robot control, AI, DL, IoT, data analysis, and a lot more field. XD
### Zhuoliang Pu 
Hello folks! My name is [Zhuoliang Pu](https://github.com/pzl233), and I'm a transfer student major in Computer Science. I actually should have still been waiting for the acceptance letters if I didn't take an overloaded amount of courseworks when I was in community college (so that I could transfer along with one of my ex-girlfriend), and I'm really glad I made that desicion, which leads me here in a team that I'm really proud of and it's really nice to know all these brilliant people! Some of my hobbies are powerlifting, bodybuilding, reading, watching animes/NBA games, and also playing video games (favorites are [<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear) and [<em> God of War</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)) series). I'm currently in my home country, which is China. My daily routine is like study hard, train hard, eat healthy( I put on ~20kgs of fats during the pandemic, though already got out of 12kgs :), and (trying to) sleep well. Anyway, I'm really proud of being in this team and extremely looking forward to have a wonderful quarter with these guys!
