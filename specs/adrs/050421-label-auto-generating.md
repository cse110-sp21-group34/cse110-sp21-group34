# Setting auto generating label as an optional functionality

* Status: Proposed


## Context and Problem Statement

We used to have an idea which is automatically generate some labels for each day's journal entry depending on the context user write, but whether to have it as necessary became arguable.

## Considered Options

* Have manually implemented labels throughout.
* Have an option to turn on automated labels by separating keywords.


## Decision Outcome

Option 1 is proposed for now. Since we recognized this functionality may not be that necessary, we decided to set it as optional and implement it only when we have time. This would also require the use of multiple different libraries and doing the appropriate research would be time consuming.
