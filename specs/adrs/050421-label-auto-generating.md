# Setting auto generating label as an optional functionality

* Status: accepted


## Context and Problem Statement

We used to have an idea which is automatically generate some labels for each day's journal entry depending on the context user write, but whether to have
it as necessary became arguable.


## Decision Outcome

Since we recognized this functionality may not be that necessary, we decided to set it as optional and implement it only when we have time.
