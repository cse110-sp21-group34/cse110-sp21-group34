# The labels are associated with date

* Status: Approved

## Context and Problem Statement

We were uncertain about whether to use the Google Calendar API or implement our own calendar from scratch using JavaScript. This initially stemmed from the initial doubt if third-party APIs can be used. Any calendar selected should make it easier to implement a month and date pane for that is intuitive for the users to make.

## Considered Options

* Google Calendar API
* Calendar implemented from scratch

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: Google Calendar API, because

- Got the confirmation that Third-Party APIs are allowed.
- Would be more robust than a calendar implemented by a group of college undergraduates.
- Very detailed documentation on how the API can be used.
- Most users would be familiar with working with this API from other websites that utilize it, thereby improving User Experience.
