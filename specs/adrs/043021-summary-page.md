# [Having a seperate summary page for statistics of labels]

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We have decided to support the functionality to highlight the days with selected labels, but set it as a seperate page or just on the landing page became a problem.


## Considered Options

* Only implement this on the landing page.
* Having a seperate summary page. -- where days with selected labels will be highlighted on an integrated graphical calander.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Having a seperate summary page", because this would look more tidy and having a seperate page we can also add other useful functionalities with regard to labels.
