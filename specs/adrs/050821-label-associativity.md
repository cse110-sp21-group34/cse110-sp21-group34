# The labels are associated with date

* Status: Approved <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We were uncertain about whether to associate labels with just dates, or to also associate them with each bullets.


## Considered Options

* Associate labels with each date alone.
* Associate them with each bullet.

## Decision Outcome


Chosen Option: Associate labels with each date alone. A date can have multiple labels associated with them. Because,
 - This option was chose since having both labels and bullet styles attached to a label would make it unnecessarily complicated for the user. 
 - Also, within a day, each label can be looked at relatively easily. Having labels for dates makes it easier for the user to get an overview of their dates are planned and really nail down the purpose of having labels in the first place.
