# Support both randomly generated and user choosable colors for labels

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

We have decided to make labels colorful, but how should we assign colors to newly added labels?

## Considered Options

* Randomly generate
* Provide a panel for user to choose
* Combining both -- where there will be a randomly generated color, but users are also free to change it.


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Combining both", because some users don't really want to choose colors everytime, while some want to choose colors that they like. Supports both randomly generated and user choosable colors for labels will perfectly solve this.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Randomly generate

* Good, because it saves time for users who don't really care about the colors.
* Bad, because the layout could be very ugly, and there are definitely some users care about this.


### Provide a panel for user to choose

* Good, because it provides more creativity and options for users.
* Bad, because it could be very inconvenient for users to manlly chose a color every time they want to add a label.


### Combining both

* Good, because it solves combines both options' advantages and solves their disadvantages.
